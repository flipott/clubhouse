# Clubhouse

A message board that requires users be logged in to see and create posts. This project was my first exposure to authentication and validation within Node.js.

Live page viewable here: https://clubhouse-e1vl.onrender.com/ (Note: refresh page 30 seconds after opening if it doesn't load initially - due to free Render hosting)

# Features
- Users can create accounts and log in
- Logged in users can read messages from other registered users
- Logged in users can create posts which get added to the database

# Tools Used
